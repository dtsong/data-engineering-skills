# Data Engineering Skills — Agent Directives

Instructions for AI agents (Claude, Codex, Copilot) working in this repository.

## Skill Governance Directive

All skills in this repository must comply with the Skill Governance Specification.

### Token Budgets (Hard Limits)

- Coordinator SKILL.md: ≤800 tokens (~600 words)
- Specialist / Standalone SKILL.md: ≤2,000 tokens (~1,500 words)
- Reference files: ≤1,500 tokens (~1,100 words)
- Maximum simultaneous context load: ≤5,000 tokens

### Architecture Rules

- Coordinators contain ONLY: classification logic, skill registry, load directive, handoff protocol
- Load one specialist at a time — never pre-load multiple specialists
- Checklists >10 items go in reference files, loaded conditionally
- Eval cases and templates live outside skill directories
- No cross-references between specialist skills — use handoff protocol

### Writing Rules

- Procedure steps use imperative sentences — no explanatory prose
- Decision points as inline conditionals — no nested sub-sections
- One compact output example per skill — no redundant schema descriptions
- Reference files are pure content — no preamble or meta-instructions

### Enforcement

Pre-commit hooks validate: token budgets, frontmatter, reference integrity,
cross-skill isolation, and suite context load ceiling.

Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to check compliance manually.

Full spec: `pipeline/specs/SKILL-GOVERNANCE-SPEC.md`

### When Creating or Editing Skills

1. Check budget with `python3 pipeline/hooks/check_token_budget.py <file>`
2. Validate frontmatter with `python3 pipeline/hooks/check_frontmatter.py <file>`
3. Use templates in `pipeline/templates/` as starting points
4. Run full validation before committing: `pre-commit run --all-files`
