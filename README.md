> Expert-level Claude Code skills for data engineering: dbt, Fivetran, Kafka, Airflow, Snowflake, and more.

This repository contains a curated suite of skills that enable Claude Code to provide expert guidance for data engineering workflows. Whether you're building data pipelines, modeling in dbt, integrating SaaS tools, or streaming events with Kafka, these skills help Claude understand your context and provide detailed, actionable guidance.

**What problem does this solve?** Data engineering involves many specialized tools (dbt, Fivetran, Kafka, Airflow, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.) with deep best practices. These skills give Claude the domain expertise to help you make decisions, write code, debug issues, and architect solutions across the modern data stack.

## Role-Based Presets

Not sure which skills to install? We've created presets for common roles:

| Role | Skills Installed | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **analytics-engineer** | dbt-transforms, python-data-engineering | Transform and model data using SQL and Python |
| **data-platform-engineer** | All skills | Full toolkit for building and maintaining data platforms |
| **integration-engineer** | data-integration, event-streaming, data-pipelines | Connect systems, orchestrate pipelines, handle real-time data |
| **ml-engineer** | python-data-engineering, ai-data-integration, tsfm-forecast | Python-first workflows, AI/ML pipelines, time-series forecasting |
| **data-consultant** | dbt-transforms, duckdb, client-delivery, dlt-extract, data-pipelines, data-testing | End-to-end data cleaning engagements |

**Example**:
```bash
./install.sh --role analytics-engineer
```

This installs:
- dbt-transforms (modeling, testing, CI/CD, performance)
- python-data-engineering (dbt-py, Pandas, PySpark, API scripts)
- Shared references (data-quality-patterns, warehouse-comparison)

## How Skills Work

Skills are **prompt templates** that give Claude deep domain knowledge. Here's how they work:

1. **Auto-activation**: When you mention keywords like "dbt", "Fivetran", "Kafka", or "Airflow", Claude automatically loads the relevant skill.
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Skills provide core guidance first, then offer references for deep dives (e.g., "See dbt-testing-guide.md for 30+ test examples").
3. **No manual activation needed**: You don't need to explicitly invoke skills—just start asking questions.
4. **Context-aware**: Skills know when to activate based on your conversation, file context, and project structure.

**Example conversation**:

> **You**: "Help me write a dbt staging model for Stripe charges"
>
> **Claude** (dbt-transforms auto-activates): "I'll help you create a staging model following dbt best practices. Here's a model that handles Stripe's nested JSON structure and adds data quality tests..."
